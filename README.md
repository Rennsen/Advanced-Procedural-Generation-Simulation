# Advanced-Procedural-Generation-Simulation

## Overview

The **Advanced Procedural Generation Simulation** project is an exploration of procedural content generation techniques within the context of simulating natural environments. This project aims to generate virtual worlds consisting of islands, water sources, landmasses, and endless world exploration, all created procedurally through code. By leveraging procedural generation, the project can generate unique and diverse worlds with each execution, providing endless possibilities for exploration and study. This project is a more complex and improved version of the first published [**Procedural Generation Simulation**](https://github.com/Rennsen/Procedural-Generation-Simulation)

## Features

- **Random World Generation**: The project generates virtual worlds randomly using procedural algorithms, resulting in unique landscapes with each execution.
- **Water Sources**: Bodies of water such as oceans, lakes, and rivers are dynamically generated, contributing to the realism of the simulated environments.
- **Landmass Generation**: The project creates improved landmasses, forming the foundation for the terrain and landscape with the addition of hills, rocky mountains, snowy peaks...
- **Endless World**: The world is generated endlessly around the player by introducing chunk generations.
- **Player Interaction**: Users can navigate and explore the generated worlds using a player character, allowing for immersive experiences within the virtual environments.
- **Complete Collisions**: Added a complete collision system allowinf the player to fully interact with the generated world (jump collisions, climbing, sliding on steep surfaces...)

## Technologies Used

The **Procedural Generation Simulation** project is built using the following technologies:

- **Unity**: The project is developed using the Unity game engine, providing a robust framework for creating interactive 3D environments.
- **C#**: The primary programming language used for scripting and implementing procedural generation algorithms within Unity.
- **Perlin Noise**: Perlin noise algorithms are utilized for generating terrain features such as elevation, creating natural-looking landscapes.
- **Random Number Generation**: Random number generation techniques are employed to introduce variability and randomness into the world generation process.

## Getting Started

To run the **Advanced Procedural Generation Simulation** project locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Unity installed on your system. You can download Unity from the official website: [Unity Download](https://unity.com/products).
2. Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.
3. Open the project in Unity by navigating to the project directory and opening the main Unity scene file.
4. Once the project is open in Unity, you can build and run the simulation to explore the procedurally generated worlds.

## Future Enhancements

While the **Advanced Procedural Generation Simulation** project provides a solid foundation for exploring procedural content generation, there are several areas for future enhancement, including:

- **Advanced Terrain Features**: Introduce additional terrain features such as caves, cliffs, and valleys to enhance the realism and diversity of the landscapes.
- **Dynamic Weather System**: Implement a dynamic weather system to simulate changing weather conditions such as rain, fog, and storms, further enhancing the immersive experience.
- **Biome Variation**: Incorporate biome variation to generate different types of environments, including forests, deserts, and snowy regions, based on geographical characteristics and climate patterns.
- **Interactive Elements**: Add interactive elements such as wildlife, NPCs, and quest systems to create engaging gameplay experiences within the generated worlds.
